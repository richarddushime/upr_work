# Graphs Algorithm 

Below are the topics that I will cover 

Classical polynomial-time solvable problems. 
Graph searches (DFS, BFS), applications: 2-Satisfiability, topological sorting. Shortest paths: Dijkstra’s algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm. Minimum spanning trees*: Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithm.

Network flows, Menger’s theorem, connectivity, matchings.
