# The algorithm runs in O(V + E) time because:
# 1. We perform a DFS which visits each vertex and edge once, taking O(V + E) time.
# 2. Counting edges involves summing the lengths of adjacency lists, which also takes O(V + E) time.
# Thus, the overall time complexity is O(V + E).
# The minimum number of edges in a connected graph with n vertices is n-1, as shown by induction:
# Base case: For n=1, a single vertex has 0 edges, which is 1-1=0.
# Inductive step: Assume true for n=k. For n=k+1, adding one vertex to a connected graph with k vertices
# requires at least one additional edge to maintain connectivity, resulting in (k-1)+1 = k edges.
# Therefore, by induction, every connected graph with n vertices has at least n-1 edges.    
# This is tight, as trees (connected acyclic graphs) have exactly n-1 edges.
